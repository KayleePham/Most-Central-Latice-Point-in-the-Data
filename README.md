# Most-Central-Latice-Point-in-the-Data
- Use "input2.text" for input file
- Reads a set of data (lattice points - ordered pairs with both coordinates integer) from a file, stores that data into a data structure, and finds a lattice point which is \most central" (technically there can be ties) to the data set and the total distance to a lattice point which is \most central" to the data using both the L1 (ie Manhattan) and L2 (ie normal distance) metrics.
